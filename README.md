**🔥FLAME DETECTION AND ALERT SYSTEM**

**📌 Project Overview :-**

This project detects the presence of fire using an IR flame sensor. When a flame is detected, a buzzer sounds an alert, and a servo motor performs a safety action such as rotating toward the fire. A capacitor ensures smooth operation of the servo by stabilizing the power supply. This system provides quick fire detection and an automated response to enhance safety.

**⚙️ Working Principle :-**

The IR flame sensor continuously detects the presence of a flame.

If a flame is detected, the buzzer turns ON to alert nearby people.

Simultaneously, the servo motor rotates toward the flame to indicate direction or trigger a safety mechanism.

The capacitor stabilizes the servo power to ensure smooth movement.

The system continuously monitors for flames and provides instant alerts.

**💻 Code Explanation :-**

**IR Flame Sensor:-**
Detects fire and sends a HIGH/LOW signal to Arduino.

**Servo Motor:-**
Rotates to a specific angle when fire is detected. Helps indicate the flame’s direction.

**Buzzer Alert:-**
Turns ON when a flame is detected for instant warning.

**Capacitor:-**
Ensures stable voltage to the servo for smooth rotation.

**Arduino Logic:-**
Continuously reads the flame sensor. If flame detected → buzzer ON + servo rotation. Else → buzzer OFF + servo neutral.
