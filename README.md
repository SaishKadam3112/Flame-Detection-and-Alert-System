**🔥FLAME DETECTION AND ALERT SYSTEM**

**📌 Project Overview :-**

This project detects the presence of fire using an IR flame sensor. When a flame is detected, a buzzer sounds an alert, and a servo motor performs a safety action such as rotating toward the fire. A capacitor ensures smooth operation of the servo by stabilizing the power supply. This system provides quick fire detection and an automated response to enhance safety.
