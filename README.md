# Flame-Detection-and-Alert-System
This project uses an IR flame sensor with Arduino Uno to detect fire and trigger an instant alert. When a flame is detected, the buzzer sounds an Alert while the servo motor rotates for a safety action. A capacitor stabilizes power, ensuring smooth servo operation and reliable fire response.
